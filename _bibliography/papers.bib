abstract={In this paper, we introduce an approach called coupled filters decomposition, which builds on the key observation that redundancy exists among filters within a convolutional layer, meaning that similar filters can produce partially overlapping outputs. Leveraging this insight, we propose a joint decomposition of filters using coupled tensor decompositions, specifically coupled canonical polyadic decomposition, which enables the sharing of a common factor matrix across similar filters. This joint factorization not only reduces the number of parameters but also lowers computational complexity by eliminating redundant computations. To further enhance the efficiency of our approach, we first cluster the filters (prior to decomposition) into groups that are better suited for coupled decomposition‚Äîwhere the coupling constraint is less restrictive‚Äîusing a custom metric based on the shared mode subspace. Extensive experiments across various architectures, datasets, and tasks validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art model compression techniques.},

title={Singular values-driven automated filter pruning},
author={Pham, Van Tien and Zniyed, Yassine and Nguyen, Thanh Phuong},
abstract={In this paper, we present SLIMING (Singular vaLues-drIven autoMated filter
prunING), an automated filter pruning method that uses singular values to formalize
the pruning process as an optimization problem over filter tensors. Recognizing that
this original formulation poses a combinatorial challenge, we propose to replace it
with a two-step process that consistently uses singular values in each phase: $(i)$
determining the pruning configuration, which specifies the number of filters to retain
in each layer, and $(ii)$ selecting the filters themselves. We show that this approach
ensures the preservation of the filters' multidimensional structure throughout the
pruning process. For each of these steps, we propose a straightforward algorithm to
solve them. To validate each part of our approach, we performed a numerical
simulation on an overparameterized synthetic toy example. Additionally, we
conducted extensive simulations across eight architectures, four benchmark
datasets, and four vision tasks, validating the efficacy of our framework.},

abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of deep learning, the proliferation of large-scale neural networks has brought forth new horizons of artificial intelligence. However, their sheer size and computational demands have posed significant challenges, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. The overarching problem of network compression seeks to mitigate these challenges by efficiently designing deep neural models. In this report, we embark on a journey to address this problem, exploring novel avenues for model compression. Our first contribution, CORING, introduces a pioneering filter pruning method that harnesses tensor decomposition, preserving the multidimensional essence of filters. By leveraging the power of CORING, we achieve impressive reductions in model size and computational requirements while retaining or even enhancing performance. CORING's ability to generalize models through pruning is demonstrated across various architectures and datasets. The second contribution, NORTON, unveils a hybrid network compression technique that combines tensor decompositions with structured pruning. NORTON offers a comprehensive approach to model compression, optimizing architecture, and reducing the number of parameters. With NORTON, we attain superior compression ratios and accuracy retention, making it a versatile tool for model optimization. Looking ahead, our research sets the stage for future investigations. Potential avenues include delving deeper into the compression domain, expanding to encompass various decomposition techniques, exploring a broader spectrum of neural network architectures, and applying these efficient models to diverse applications. As we navigate the evolving landscape of deep learning, the pursuit of efficient model design remains at the forefront, driving innovation and unlocking the potential for AI in resource-constrained scenarios.},

  abstract={Egocentric vision is an emerging field of computer vision characterized by the acquisition video from the first person perspective. Particularly, for evaluating upper extremity rehabilitation, egocentric vision offers the ability to quantitatively measure the function of hands used in physical-based exercises. For such applications, hand detection and tracking are the first requirement. In this work, we develop a fully automatic tracking by detection pipeline that firstly extracts hands positions and then tracks hands in consecutive frames. The proposed framework consists of state of the art detectors such as RCNN and YOLO family models coupled with advanced trackers (e.g., SORT and DeepSORT) for tracking task. This paper explores how performance of the stand alone object detection algorithms correlates with overall performance of a tracking by detection system. The experimental results show that detection highly impacts the overall performance. Moreover, this work also proves that the use of visual descriptors in the tracking stage can reduce the number of identity switches and thereby increase potential of the whole system. We also present challenges for new egocentric hand tracking dataset for future works.},
