I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.univ-tln.fr/">Universit√© de Toulon</a>, <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/fr">CNRS</a>, <a href="https://www.lis-lab.fr/">LIS, France</a>, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. <a href="https://yzniyed.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html">Yassine Zniyed</a> and Prof. <a href="https://webusers.i3s.unice.fr/~tpnguyen/">Thanh Phuong Nguyen</a>. My thesis focuses on neural network compression and acceleration, with an emphasis on techniques such as pruning and tensor decomposition.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at the Modelling and Simulation Centre, <a href="https://viettelhightech.vn/en">Viettel High Technologies Industry Corporation</a>, where I contributed to the development of a car driving training simulation system. This experience allowed me to develop skills in computer graphics, programming, 3D game engines, databases, and network engineering.

I earned my engineering and master's degrees from <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/en/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/">School of Information and Communications Technology</a>. During this time, I worked with Assoc. Profs. <a href="https://mica.edu.vn/perso/Tran-Thi-Thanh-Hai/">Thanh Hai Tran</a>, <a href="https://www.mica.edu.vn/perso/Le-Thi-Lan/index.html">Thi Lan Le</a>, and <a href="https://www.mica.edu.vn/perso/Vu-Hai/">Hai Vu</a> at the <a href="https://mica.edu.vn/index.php?lang=en"> International Research Institute MICA</a> on object detection, segmentation, and tracking from egocentric vision.
